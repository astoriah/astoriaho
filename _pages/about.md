Hello! I am a recent graduate student from [UC Berkeley's MIMS program](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims). 

When I studied gerontology at `USC`, I became passionate about developing aging-technology. I worked for a startup whose goal was to connect family caregivers with eldercare experts as a product design intern. And then worked for AARP's Innovation Labs, as a product design consultant for their portfolio startups. 

I learned that I love design, talking to users, and helping startups grow their product and customer base. 

At `UC Berkeley`, I continued to work with both small and large companies through client project work. I led a team to better understand Salesforce's positioning on digital contracts. And I engaged with several more age-tech startups on developing their product & product management strategies.    

See more about my client projects on my [Work page](/work/)!
