        I joined ReverCare during their time at Y-Combinator in Summer 2019. The team consisted of the co-founders, lead engineer, and two interns (myself included).
        <br>
        Over my summer internship, I primarily worked on prototyping their web application and collaborating with the engineer to implement my designs.
        <br><br>
        Post-internship, I continued working at ReverCare shifting gears from product design to marketing design and communications. 
        <br><br>Here I share my biggest takeaways from working at an early-stage startup.

    I was a studying gerontology at USC when I joined ReverCare so I was familiar with eldercare, the stakeholders involved, and complexity surrounding organizing care. 
    <br>
    However, it was my volunteering work with hospice care where I was involved with nurses, care homes, family members, and patients that allowed me to grasp the problem space we were designing for. 
    <br><br>
    I stayed connected with family caregivers and eldercare experts through my work. 
    <br>
    I began a series called "A day in the life of a caregiver" and "Revercare Features" where I interviewed 11 family caregivers about their experiences and shared them on our blog and social media.

I learned: 
- Caregiving is a marathon. Primarily one family member is tasked with caring for their older person and they are involved with their care every day. 
- Caregivers need support. Some turn to social media to share, encourage, and talk to other family caregivers. Others are part of support groups led by eldercare experts. 
- Caregivers don't have time for themselves. Many caregivers experience loneliness because caring requires they stay home and they don't have the help they need to take a break.

I loved reaching out and speaking to caregivers. Spending the time to listen and support caregivers made me a better designer because I can better picture what life in their shoes looks like. 

`It is so important to seek out opportunities to empathize with who you are designing for.`

    One of ReverCare's primary goals was to create a working MVP of their platform during their summer at Y Combinator. 
    <br><br>
    We needed to built two front-end interfaces: one for family caregivers and one for eldercare experts. I focused on designing the UI for family caregivers to engage with their care team. 
    <br><br>
    I had to build prototypes quickly and iterate based on feedback from the founders and developer feasibility.
